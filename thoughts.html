      I frequently wonder, after coming to the PhD program, whether this experience is worth it. Is spending five or even six years of my life, when I'm nearly 30, really going to give me what I'm looking for in life? Or even more foundamentally, what a PhD program really is. I had a good talk with a friend today and I think sometimes we fail to realize the growth that happen because we are so extremely familiar with ourselves that these incremental changes fail to catch our own attention.
      <br><br>
      However, I think what I realized is that, this journey isn't really only about academic growth. As I look back on last year, it really is quite astonishing how different of a person I am in comparison. I have always taken pride in my own introspective tendencies. This journey has taught, and shown me the different aspects of myself that I don't like, through seeing the actions of others. It also shows me how I want to be a better person.
